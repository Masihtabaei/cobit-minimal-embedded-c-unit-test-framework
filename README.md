# Cobit - A Minimal Embedded C Unit Test Framework

## General Information

Here you will find a minimal unit test framework for C to use in your embedded project.

I created this framework over the night in summer of 2023 for testing my embedded programs
written in C for Nucleo-Board (with an Arm Cortex M4 beased processor / STM32G474).
It uses the sprintf and a two dimensional array as a buffer to display the test results.
I called it **cobit**. **cobit** is a partial blend (**Coburg** \[name of a small city located in Bavaria in Southern Germany\] + **Unit** \[for unit tests\])
Feel free to extend/adjust this project so that it meets your goals.

## Usage/Example

There is a file (example.c) which shows you how to use this minimal test framework.
You can not execute that file (becaue there are other header files that you have to add to your project)
but the purpose of this file should be giving you ideas how can you use this framework your personal projects.
